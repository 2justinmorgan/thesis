About the Bad Bot Report
Distil Networks' 2019 Bad Bot Report investigates the daily attacks that sneak past sensors and wreak havoc on websites. It's based on 2018 data collected from Distil Networks' global network and includes hundreds of billions of bad bot requests anonymized over thousands of domains. Our goal is to offer guidance about the nature and impact of automated threats to those of you on the frontlines of website security.
What makes this report unique is its focus on bad bot activity at the application layer (layer 7 of the OSI model). Automated application layer attacks differ from volumetric DDoS attacks, the latter of which manipulate lower level network protocols.
Bad bots interact with applications in the same way a legitimate user would, making them harder to prevent. They enable high-speed abuse, misuse, and attacks on your websites and APIs. They enable attackers, unsavory competitors, and fraudsters to perform a wide array of malicious activities.
Such activities include web scraping, competitive data mining, personal and financial data harvesting, brute-force login and digital ad fraud, spam, transaction fraud, and more.

The Business of Bots is Money
While it's well known that bots were used to exploit social media sites in an attempt to influence political dialogue and elections, the real motivation behind the majority of bad bots is more simple--money.
While the goal of each bot operator might be different depending on their industry, bots are the tool of choice and are vital to their success. There is an ecosystem within many industries that rely on bots for survival. Without their use, many such operators would struggle to compete. In many cases, deploying bad bots is an essential business practice.
Every industry has its own bad bot problem and ecosystem of bot operators. Some of these include:

 Airlines There is an ecosystem of online travel agents, aggregators, and competitors that use bots to scrape content--including flight information, pricing, and seat availability--while criminals attempt to fraudulently access user accounts that contain loyalty program awards and credit card information.1
 Ecommerce Competitors use bad bots to aggressively scrape pricing and inventory information. Criminals use them to commit fraud by stealing gift card balances and to access user accounts and credit card information.
 Event Ticketing Brokers, scalpers, hospitality agencies, and corporations use bad bots to check for ticket availability and to purchase available seats to resell on secondary markets. Criminals access user accounts to steal tickets and credit card information. 2

But for any business whose website, mobile app, or API is the unfortunate target of malicious bots, the story is the complete opposite. Not only does it have to deal with the competitive pricing pressure resulting from the scraping bots, but it has to maintain infrastructure uptime and redundancy so that real customers aren't inconvenienced. In addition, they also suffer from skewed decision-making metrics because their web traffic has been polluted by bad bots.
To add insult to injury, the financial investment sector also deploys bots to scrape for information such as inventory levels and pricing data. Sometimes known as alternative data, this information is used by hedge funds to make investment decisions. A recent report estimated that 5% of all web traffic is attributable to investment-scraping bots.3

The Business of Bots is Money
To understand the scale of the bot problem, the report also estimated that hedge funds are expected to pay $2B in 2020 to collect and store data that was scraped from websites.
"Hedge funds are expected to pay $2B in 2020 to collect and store data that was scraped from websites."
This clearly shows the business value of running bad bots. So not only can competitors use them to beat you in the marketplace, and criminals can use them to defraud your business, but the investment community also uses them to potentially punish your business performance based on any gathered information. It would be wrong to consider bots as being benign.
The Data Breach Problem Escalates the Bad Bot Volume
The increasing volume of stolen credentials from data breaches is creating a worsening bot problem for any online business having a login page. Bots are used by criminals to test the viability of stolen credentials. Every new data breach sees an increased availability of credentials and leads to higher volumes of bad bot traffic. With over 14 billion credentials stolen since 2013, the problem is already significant--and only getting worse.

Data records lost or stolen since 2013 https://breachlevelindex.com/ (April 2019)
Global Legislation Still Focused on Ticketing
In the past few years, governments in the US; UK; Ontario, Canada; New South Wales, Australia; and New Zealand have either recently enacted legislation to prevent bots in ticketing, or they plan to in the near future. And yet there is still very limited enforcement. And what about all the other industries suffering from bad bot abuse?

The Industry Analysts' View of Bot Management
Increasingly, the major industry analyst firms are realizing that bot management was a blind spot in the cybersecurity landscape. They're recommending that for comprehensive web application security, addressing bad bots is a key component. The days of only considering DDoS and web application firewall (WAF) solutions are over. Then in Q3 2018, Forrester released its first evaluation of bot management vendors.
The Evolution of Bad Bots is an Arms Race
Bad bots are evolving and are more sophisticated than ever. Increasingly they're mimicking real human workflows across web applications to "behave" like real users. Bots are obfuscating their activity by reverse engineering detection systems. Advanced attackers now show definitive behavior that they know about the technology they're trying to defeat, and they're continuously learning how to adapt their tactics. For example, there are more occurrences of globally distributed botnet attacks, using tactics like single request attacks, user agent rotation, random mouse movements, and page scrolling, to name a few.
"The bot arms race is very real; bot defenders and bot operators are playing a continual game of cat and mouse."

Executive Summary of Findings
The Bot Problem Affects Every Industry
Some bad bot problems run across all industries while others are industry-specific. Websites with login screens are hit by bot-driven account takeover attacks two to three times per month. Content and price scraping is rampant and is undertaken by bots. Meanwhile, nefarious competitors use bots to undercut prices on ecommerce sites, hoard seats on airline flights, and scalp the best concert tickets.

The Bad Bot Landscape
What is a bad bot?
Bad bots scrape data from sites without permission in order to reuse it (e.g., pricing, inventory levels) and gain a competitive edge. The truly nefarious ones undertake criminal activities, such as fraud and outright theft. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a list of the different bad bot types in its Automated Threat Handbook. 4
How Do Good and Bad Bots Differ?
In simplistic terms, good bots ensure that online businesses and their products can be found by prospective customers. Examples include search engine crawlers such as GoogleBot and Bingbot that, through their indexing, help people match their queries with the most relevant sets of websites.
Even Good Bots Can Be Bad News
Good bots can skew web analytics reports, making some pages appear more popular than they actually are. For example, if you advertise on your website, good bots can generate an impression, but that ad click never converts in the sales funnel. This results in lower performance for advertisers. Being able to intelligently separate traffic generated by legitimate human users, good bots, and bad bots is essential for making informed business decisions.
Bad Bot vs. Good Bot. vs Human Traffic 2018
In 2018, bad bots accounted for 20.4% of all website traffic--a 6.35% decrease over the prior year. Good bots decreased by 14.4%, accounting for 17.5% of all traffic. This past year the proportion of human traffic increased by 7.5%, totalling 62.1% of all internet traffic.

Bad Bot vs. Good Bot vs. Human Traffic 2014 - 2018

The bad bot traffic percentage has decreased slightly for the first time since 2015, but still accounts for 1 in 5 web requests.
The good news is that the number of human users is up in comparison with bots for the first time since 2016. But it's still surprising to see that human traffic comprises only 62% of all internet traffic. When the goal is to attract real humans to your website, these numbers show that the bot problem is still significant.

The Bad Bot Landscape
Bad Bot Sophistication Levels
Distil Networks created the following industry standard system that classifies the sophistication level of the following four bad bot types:

 Simple Connecting from a single, ISP-assigned IP address, this type connects to sites using automated scripts, not browsers, and doesn't self-report (masquerade) as being a browser.

Bad Bot Sophistication Levels 2018

 Moderate Being more complex, this type uses "headless browser" software that simulates browser technology-- including the ability to execute JavaScript.

 Sophisticated Producing mouse movements and clicks that fool even sophisticated detection methods, these bad bots mimic human behavior and are the most evasive. They use browser automation software, or malware installed within real browsers, to connect to sites.

 Advanced Persistent Bots (APBs) APBs are a combination of moderate and sophisticated bad bots. They tend to cycle through random IP addresses, enter through anonymous proxies and peer-to-peer networks, and are able to change their user agents. They use a mix of technologies and methods to evade detection while maintaining persistency on target sites.

For the second year in a row, the sophistication levels are very similar.
Simple bots, which are easiest to detect, accounted for 26.4% of bad bot traffic. Meanwhile, the majority of non-human traffic (52.5%) came from those classified as moderate. And sophisticated bad bots, the most difficult to detect, comprised of 21.1% of automated traffic last year.
Advanced persistent bots (APBs) accounted for 73.6% of all 2018 bad bot traffic--almost matching the prior year. Because they can cycle through IP addresses and switch user agents, simple IP blacklisting is wholly ineffective.
Known as "low and slow," APBs carry out significant assaults using fewer requests and can even delay requests, all the while staying below request rate limits. This method reduces the "noise" generated by many bad bot campaigns.

Bad Bots by Industry
By examining traffic from various industries, a deeper insight into the bot problem is possible. As more organizations add bot management to their security profile, a larger data set is gathered across more industries. For the 2018 Bad Bot Report, data was collected from 11 industries. For this report the number of industries expanded to 20.

The Bad Bot Landscape
Financial Services Financial Services companies have the highest percentage of bad bots with 42.2%. Such companies typically suffer from bad bots attempting to access user accounts.
Ticketing One of the first industries targeted by bad bots, has the second highest percentage with 39.3%. Scalping bots, seat inventory checkers, and credential stuffing bots that access user accounts are most prevalent on these sites.
Education A new industry sector included in this study, had 37.9% bad bot traffic. Bots are deployed by malicious operators looking for research papers, class availability, and to access user accounts.
Government Government with 29.9% of bad bots, is interested in protecting business registration listings from scraping bots, and in stopping election bots from interfering with voter registration accounts.
Gambling and Gaming Gambling and Gaming companies, with 25.9% of bad bot traffic, suffer from aggregators relentlessly scraping for ever-changing betting lines. Account takeovers are also a major problem because each account contains money or loyalty points that, once compromised, can easily be transferred to another user and emptied.
Airlines Airlines have a challenging problem with 25.9% of their traffic comprising bad bots. Prices are scraped not only by direct competitors, but also by third-party players in the expansive travel ecosystem. Unauthorized online travel agencies (OTAs), competitors, price aggregators, and metasearch sites use sophisticated scraping bots to abuse the business logic of booking engines. Querying for any ticket they can sell, they skew look-to-book ratios, increase GDS transaction costs, and are responsible for site slowdowns and downtime--causing customer dissatisfaction during disruptions. In addition, airlines suffer from account takeover issues as bad bot operators attempt to get into user accounts and empty them of accumulated air mile balances.
Ecommerce Ecommerce companies see a wide range of bad bot attacks. These include price scraping, content scraping, account takeovers, credit card fraud, and gift card abuse. Having one of the largest datasets, ecommerce has 18.0% of the bad bot traffic.

Bad Bots Sophistication by Industry
Comparing bad bot sophistication levels by industry reveals a very different picture. Ticketing, healthcare, directories & classifieds, and ecommerce see the highest proportion of sophisticated bots. It's important to understand that the volume of bots doesn't necessarily equate with sophistication. For example, a sophisticated bot may make fewer requests to achieve its goal.

"Bad bots continuously target all of these industries daily, with defenses requiring constant optimization. Every industry is attacked to check the viability of stolen credentials. Some are hit by sophisticated bots that repeatedly perform a specific task, such as checking credit card numbers. Another may be scraped for pricing content, while a third may be victimized by bad bots checking gift card balances. Every bot problem is unique; factors to consider include the nature of the business, its website content, and the goal of the adversary. The bad bot problem affects every industry. But each company has a unique bad bot problem."

Bad Bot Traffic by Day of the Week
Wednesday was the most popular day for bad bot traffic in 2018. The consistency of such traffic on each weekday confirms the relentless nature of bots. The weekend is the lowest two days for bot traffic, which suggests that bot operators use bad bots as part of their day job.

Bad Bots Traffic by Website Size 2018
Distil defines website size according to its Alexa index,5 whereby sites are ranked by the amount of traffic received. An Alexa score of 1 means it's the most popular internet site-- as of this writing that's Google.com. We used Alexa rankings to categorize sizes as follows:

 Large: Alexa 1 - 10,000  Medium: Alexa 10,001 - 50,000  Small: Alexa 50,001 - 150,000  Tiny: Alexa 150,000+

Bad bots must disguise their identity to avoid detection. They do so by reporting their user agent as a web browser or mobile device. While the majority of bad bots claim to be the most popular browsers, during 2018 bad bots claimed a total of 523 different identities (user agents).
In 2018, Chrome continued to be the most popular fake identity used by bad bots, with almost half (49.9%) of them making this claim. Firefox dropped to 17.5% but is the second most popular claimed identity. Android WebKit Browser was claimed by 8.8% and is the only mobile browser in the top three.

Why Use Out-of-Date Browsers? Perhaps some bad bots were written many years ago and remain on the prowl. Some may have targeted systems that only accept specific browser versions. Others may be out-of-control programs, bouncing around the internet in endless loops, still causing collateral damage.

Bad Bots Weaponize Data Centers
The weaponization of the data center continues, but was slightly less than the previous year. Almost three-quarters (73.6%) of bad bot traffic came from data centers in 2018, compared with 82.7% in 2017. The continued global availability of low-cost cloud computing is what accounts for this dominance of data center use. Bad bot traffic from mobile ISPs increased - from 2.5% the year prior to 3.6% in 2018. Residential bad bot traffic also increased from 14.8% to 22.7% in 2018.

Why Block Countries? Many companies use geofencing blacklists to choke off large swaths of unwanted traffic. In some cases, it simply doesn't make sense that foreign visitors would use a given site, so blocking chunks of foreign IP addresses is good hygiene. In other situations, customers have suffered attacks from countries that haven't traditionally generated good traffic, so have taken sensible protection measures.
Because of its notorious status, a third (32.6%) of all blocking requests were preventing access from Russia.
Russia and Ukraine combined accounted for 48.2% of country-specific block requests.
For the second year running, the United States is on the most-blocked list, accounting for 6.6% of country-specific block requests.
India is now the third most-blocked country at 15.2%. This is a significant increase from the prior year when it was the 10th most blocked country (at 2.1%).

Recommendations
Bots are on your website every day, and attack characteristics become more advanced and very nuanced over time. How should businesses go about protecting themselves? Unfortunately, every site is targeted for different reasons, and usually by different methods, so there is no one-size-fits-all bot solution. But there are some proactive steps you can take to start addressing the problem.

Recommendations for Detecting Bad Bot Activity

1. Block or CAPTCHA Outdated User Agents/Browsers The default configurations for many tools and scripts contain user-agent string lists that are largely outdated. This step won't stop the more advanced attackers, but it might catch and discourage some. The risk in blocking outdated user agents/browsers is very low; most modern browsers force auto-updates on users, making it more difficult to surf the web using an outdated version.
We recommend you block or CAPTCHA the following browser versions:

Firefox version Chrome version Internet Explorer version
Safari version

2. Block Known Hosting Providers and Proxy Services Even if the most advanced attackers move to other, more-difficult-to-block networks, many less sophisticated perpetrators use easily accessible hosting and proxy services. Disallowing access from these sources might discourage attackers from coming after your site, API, and mobile apps.

3. Block All Access Points Be sure to protect exposed APIs and mobile apps - not just your website - and share blocking information between systems wherever possible. Protecting your website does little good if backdoor paths remain open.
4. Carefully Evaluate Traffic Sources Monitor traffic sources carefully. Do any have high bounce rates? Do you see lower conversion rates from certain traffic sources? They can be signs of bot traffic.
5. Investigate Traffic Spikes Traffic spikes appear to be a great win for your business. But can you find a clear, specific source for the spike? One that is unexplained can be a sign of bad bot activity.
6. Monitor for Failed Login Attempts Define your failed login attempt baseline, then monitor for anomalies or spikes. Set up alerts so you're automatically notified if any occur. Advanced "low and slow" attacks don't trigger user or session-level alerts, so be sure to set global thresholds.
7. Monitor Increases in Failed Validation of Gift Card Numbers An increase in failures, or even traffic, to gift card validation pages can be a signal that bots such as GiftGhostBot are attempting to steal gift card balances.
8. Pay Close Attention to Public Data Breaches Newly stolen credentials are more likely to still be active. When large breaches occur anywhere, expect bad bots to run those credentials against your site with increased frequency.
9. Evaluate a Bot Mitigation Solution The bot problem is an arms race. Bad actors are working hard every day to attack websites across the globe. The tools used constantly evolve, traffic patterns and sources shift, and advanced bots can even mimic human behavior. Hackers using bots to target your site are distributed around the world, and their incentives are high. In early bot attack days you could protect your site with a few tweaks; this report shows that those days are long gone. Today it's almost impossible to keep up with all of the threats on your own.
Industry analysts agree, which is why Gartner has added bot defense as a core requirement for WAF and CDN vendors. Your defenses need to evolve as fast as the threats, and to do that you need dedicated support from a team of experts.
