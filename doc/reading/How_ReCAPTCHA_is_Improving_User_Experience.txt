How does reCAPTCHA v3 work? ReCAPTCHA version 3 is somewhat different to its predecessors, due to the fact that it, in Google's own words, takes away user friction. This means that instead of halting someone's journey through the website, the reCAPTCHA will assess each visitor, and return a score based on their interaction with the site. This can subsequently help you to identify speci c pages that are being targeted by these bots. This ultimately improves the usability of your site, by removing a customer's requirement to complete these, often frustrating, captchas. Google provides a comprehensive guide to reCAPTCHA here.
