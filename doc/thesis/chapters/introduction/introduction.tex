A web bots is a programmatic simulation of a human user web browsing session. Similarly, a botnet is a collection of web bots working in unison. Most of these bots are programmed with the intention of foregoing remedial and repetitive tasks that a human user would be required to do. Some examples of these tasks may include searching for specific items, of a given criteria, through a large number of items on an ecommerce site like Amazon. Another example can be the action of downloading lists textual data on a web page that would require the user to manually save. There are many use cases for these programmatic simulations, otherwise known as web bots. Unfortunately, web bots are often used maliciously or irresponsibly, thus introducing a number of problems for the users and administrators of a web site~\cite{1ee426975c3d46d2ba6ef5c2d76384c5}. Efforts to detect these web bots have proven to be successful in many cases. However, due to the increasing sophistication of web bots, said detection schemes are continuously bypassed and deemed obsolete. This work addresses some of these issues.
