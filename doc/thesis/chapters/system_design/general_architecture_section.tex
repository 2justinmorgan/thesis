The general architecture of this implementation is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{data extraction}: The position metrics, timestamp and coordinates, of the user's mouse cursor are collected from the user's computer and sent to the server for analysis. The \textit{Dataset} section outlines this stage.
    \item \textbf{features generation}: From the inputted raw data recorded and sent from the user's machine, features that characterize the raw data, and the user's session pertaining to it, are generated. The \textit{Features Engineering} section outlines this stage.
    \item \textbf{clustering}: Sessions are clustered based on the generated features. The \textit{Clustering} section outlines this stage.
    \item \textbf{classification}: Clusters of sessions are used to determine bottness of users at client IP addresses. The \textit{Classification} section outlines this stage, a stage anticipated for future work.
\end{enumerate}
