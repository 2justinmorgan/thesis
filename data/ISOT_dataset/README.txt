BioTracker Project- Mouse Dynamics Dataset

Readme- January 4, 2008

The datasets consist of two sets of raw mouse dynamics data for 22 and 26 different human users collected in 2003 and 2007, respectively; this represents in total 48 different users. The datasets consist of several files which can be opened using matlab. 
Each file consists of a number of matrices, each representing the data collected from one user.
Matrix columns represent the following:
Column 1: Type of Action (1: Mouse Move 2: Silence 3: Point Click 4: Drag drop)
Column 2: Traveled Distance in pixels
Column 3: Elapsed Time (in seconds)
Column 4: Direction of Movement (1 to 8) (actions performed within 45-degree intervals clockwise). 

Use of this data requires a written approval from the authors.
